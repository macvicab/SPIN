##Python script: This script delineates the stream network from a DEM by 1) filling errors in the DEM, 2) creating a flow direction raster, 3) creating a flow accumulation raster, 4) applying a drainage area threshold to the raster to extract the cells which belong to the stream network and 5) convert the cells which belong to the stream network into a linear feature.
##Inputs: DEM, Drainage Area Threshold
